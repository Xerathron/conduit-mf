# conduit-mf
Conduit is a example website. The origin website comes by the [realworld-community](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/). 

This project is a fork of [khaledosman/angular-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/khaledosman/angular-realworld-example-app). It extends the project by implementing a micro frontend architecture. In addition to that architecture it implements a generic error handling process.
